# Evaluate a news article project: by Jonathan Root

This is now a starter project for my capstone project and other projects moving forward.

The project includes the following

- Webpack for both dev and production
- Basic Sass styles and folder structure
- Webpack Loaders and Plugins
- Basic layout and page design with Flexbox
- Service workers
- Aylien API
- Deployed on Heroku [here](https://afternoon-crag-93745.herokuapp.com/) It might take a minute to wake up if it has been idle for too long.
